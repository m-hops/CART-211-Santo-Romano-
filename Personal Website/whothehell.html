            Hello... uhh... person. <br><br>This is my personal site.<br><br>Right now this is mostly used for school work, but as time goes on, I'll start putting up my projects and other productions. What is it I make exactly {asked no one}? Well I
            like to focus on a style of art called horror punk which is the balance of horror based themes {monsters, madness, mayhem, etc.} presented using low-grade visual mediums such as photocopied images or video game styles that are well past
            their prime.<br>*cough* this website *cough*<br><br>I'm sure by now it's no surprise to you, I only started working with web programming a month ago so please don't remind me how bad this looks; I arleady know it and there's no need to
            keep driving that point home. But as a former coworker who was incredibly drunk once told me,<br><br> "The first step to being good at something is embracing how shit you are at it".<br><br>And then he threw up at our table and we were
            told to leave the dive bar.<br><br>Ah the misery of retail. Good times.
