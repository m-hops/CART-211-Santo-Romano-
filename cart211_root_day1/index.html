<p class = "writing">
In the future, this is where I'm hoping to upload my assignments!

<p class="writingsmall">
I originally just did the basic HTML site (you know, h1, p, etc.) and thought, <br><br>"Well this looks OK and I'm pretty sure this is what Santo wanted."<br><br>But then I was curious how to make a movie background and went rooting around CSS documentation. One thing led to another with adjusting texts, fonts, margins, etc. and it looked pretty ok! But then I found out my code only worked in Firefox and completely broke in Chrome. So I had to start over again.<br><br>6 hours later we've arrived here.<br><br>The original site just looked so boring that I couldn't in good conscious submit it so I hope you, Santo, are ok with this. The reality is that at this point, I'm in way over my head as I only learned HTML 2 months ago and CSS... 6 hours ago. But this looks a lot less awful than just HTML.<br><br>As a thank you for your patience, I've included some music you may enjoy.<br><br>Please don't think it's a bribe<br><br>- Mads<br><br><audio controls src="audio\groove.mp3">

<p class="ps">
P.S. I couldn't remember if I needed to include a hyperlink or not, so I'm going to include one <a href = "https://twitter.com/DeadLetterDays">here</a> to a webcomic I make. Please don't judge me.
