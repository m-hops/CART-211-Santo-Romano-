    <h2>Alright Santo, here we go again...</h2>
    <p>Last assignment I did when compared to this one is visually better. I know you, you know it, and anybody with the gift of visibility knows it.<br>But here's the thing...<br>Last assignment I spent hours on learning as much as I could about CSS from various lesson sights and upon reviewing that code, I realized there's a ton of inefficencies that I didn't know. So, realizing this, I've decided that since I know next to nothing about CSS, I'm going to take this nice and slow and only push for more when I'm a bit further along in class.<br><br>Now with all this being said, I've decieded to rely more heavily on...."content"... so please enjoy these various totally real photos of Helvetica doing stuff.<br>Yes the font, Santos.<br>Did you know Helvetica is an avid skydiver?</p>
